# Hessian trace estimation

A tiny repository containing just one notebook. The notebook
shows how to efficiently approximate the trace of a Hessian,
using automatic differentiation ([PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)) and a recently published randomized
algorithm called [Hutch++](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09649.pdf).
